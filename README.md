# Hack-ISU-Spring-2018
This is a project me and a friends made at Hack ISU Spring 2018.
What we made is a mechanical claw that is controlled by servo motors and those servo motors are controlled by buttons on a breadboard.     
All of this was hooked up to two different Arduinos that were wired up the exact same way that were running the same exact code.
